## My process
Firstly I Understood the layout, then moved to figuring out how I can lay out the elements i.e., the division
for different sections, decided to make a main container, inside it a sub container where the two components
i.e., the QR image and the content used flex box to to align the children and then applyed styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [CSS box shadow](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me to apply box shadow to my container.
